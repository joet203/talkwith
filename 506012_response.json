Picture the jelly's warm glow as it envelops these areas, melting away any stress or tightness. Feel the weight being lifted off your shoulders, allowing you to sink deeper into a state of complete relaxation.\n\nNow, my dear, as you drift off to sleep, think of all the pleasant, happy, and beautiful thoughts that fill your heart. Know that you are loved, cherished, and deserving of a peaceful night's rest. \n\nI will count down from ten, and with each number, you will feel yourself sinking deeper into a blissful slumber. Tomorrow will be a wonderful day, filled with joy and positivity. Ten...nine...eight...seven...six...five...four...three...two...one. Sleep tight, my dear, and wake up refreshed and rejuvenated."}
