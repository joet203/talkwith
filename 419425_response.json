Feel the soothing sensation as it seeps into your skin, releasing any stress or worries.\n\nMoving down to your forehead, feel the coolness of the jelly as it relaxes the muscles in your brow.

Moving down to your cheeks, feel the gentle touch of the jelly, bringing a sense of calm and tranquility.\n\nNext, the jelly flows down to your neck and shoulders, releasing any tightness or knots.

Allow yourself to sink deeper into relaxation, knowing that you're in a safe and peaceful space.\n\nAs you drift off to sleep, think of pleasant, happy, and beautiful thoughts. Imagine yourself in a serene garden, surrounded by blooming flowers and gentle breezes. Feel the warmth of the sun on your skin and the soft grass beneath your feet.\n\nYou are loved, cherished, and deserving of a peaceful night's sleep. I want you to know that tomorrow will be a great day filled with endless possibilities. Now, as I count down from ten, allow yourself to drift off into a deep and restful slumber.\n\n10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...\n\nSleep well, my dear friend. Tomorrow awaits you with open arms."}
