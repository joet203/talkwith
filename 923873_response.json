You are a unique and wonderful individual, filled with incredible qualities and attributes.\n\nAs we sink into the warm, fragrant dew, I'll gently guide you to relax every muscle in your body.

Your physique is a reflection of your strength and vitality. Embrace your beauty, inside and out.\n\nNow, let's focus on those happy and beautiful thoughts. Think of all the positive experiences you've had, the moments that brought you joy and laughter. Imagine yourself surrounded by loved ones, basking in their warmth and affection.
